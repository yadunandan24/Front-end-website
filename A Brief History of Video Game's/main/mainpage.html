					In the beginning, there was nothing.
And then some bright spark started 
playing with an oscilloscope, as 
engineers are wont to do. The first
video games were borne upon mighty 
post-war mainframes: designed for rapid codebreaking
and the calculation of ballistic trajectories.

					Once computers made their way into 
academic institutions, there was no 
shortage of programming experimentation
- SpaceWar! is such fruit of curiosity 
from MIT in 1962. Created by Steve Russell
Spacewar! is one of the most important and
influential games in the early history of
video games. It was extremely popular in the
small programming community in the 1960s and
the public domain code was widely ported and 
recreated at other computer systems at the 
time, especially after computer systems with 
monitors became more widespread towards the
end of the decade.

					By the 1970s, the commercial application of these electronic attractions were realised
in the form of arcade games: mass produced, self contained units which dispense coin-operated
entertainment.
1972's Pong is the most iconic from this era, proving phenomenally popular and becoming
the first commercially successful game.
As computers became more powerful, games of greater complexity became possible: 1974's01:10
'Maze War' is arguably the very first FPS.
Atari's Breakout in 1976 mixed up Pong's familiar bat-and-ball paradigm, by adding destructible
bricks into the mix - although the following year saw a recession of the nascent video
game industry, largely due to the faddish nature of Pong.
A new wave of games in 1978 ushered in the golden age of the arcade, with Taito's Space
Invaders sparking the shooting genre, filling coinboxes worldwide.
Asteroids in 1979 was similarly popular, with its smooth vector graphics and slick space
gameplay thrusting it firmly into popular culture.

					The 1980s were a colourful decade, and newly available arcade technology reflected this
					with titles like Pac-Man. 1981 saw Mario's very first outing in Donkey Kong - although at
					the time he was simply known as Jumpman, for his rather mundane ability to bound over barrels.
					Another round of arcade hits dropped in '82: the excavatory exploits in Dig-Dug, the hi-octane
					racer Pole Position and the diagonal box-hopping of Q-Bert.The American release of the NES
					came in 1985, and with it Super Mario Brothers - a hugely influential side-scrolling platformer

					aspects into the top-down genre, with Solid Snake relying more on his wits than overwhelming firepower.

					In 1995, the PlayStation came into its own, with the stylish futuristic Wipeout from Psygnosis
					combining breakneck speed with cutting-edge sound and graphic design.
					1996 saw the launch of the Nintendo 64, and with it perhaps the first really successful
					foray into 3D platforming - Super Mario 64.
					The Legend of Zelda entered the third dimenson with Ocarina of Time for the N64, universally
					loved and one of the highest-rated video games of all time.
					1999 was a very good year for the FPS fan - with two competitive arena shooters facing
					off one another: Unreal Tournament from Epic, and id's Quake 3 Arena.
					By this point, 3D graphics were starting to mature, and so fast-paced polygonal action
					didn't need to compromise on graphical fidelity.
					First emerging as a mod for Half-Life, Counter-Strike boasted tense shooting action that would retain
					a huge audience to this day - and would go on to influence the later popularity of modern
					military shooters.

					Microsoft acquired Bungie to secure exclusive rights to the Halo franchise as an Xbox launch title, in a deft move that would provide the platform's killer app.
					Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell in 2002 put a high-tech twist on stealth gameplay, with the iconic glowing triad marking operative Sam Fisher's position whilst hidden in the shadows.
					2004's World of Warcraft essentially rewrote the book on MMORPGs, taking the stylised fantasy
					world from the earlier RTS titles and constructing the rich world of Azeroth for players to dwell
					within. Half Life 2 marked Valve's new Source engine, and proudly portrayed its physics capabilities
					through employment of multiple see-saw puzzles.
					Resident Evil returned the same year, with the fourth entry standing out as the best
					in the series: and the artful Shadow of The Colossus portrayed video gaming's ability
					to appeal to a higher aesthetic.We also saw the start of the seventh generation with the launch of the Xbox 360.
					2007 saw a certain series take a radical swing towards the present day, with Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare bringing the modern military shooter to the forefront of a entire generation.
					Grand Theft Auto returned in 2008 with GTA IV: a return to Liberty City with greater fidelity than ever before, marred only by frequent social interruption.

					Polytron's FEZ finally emerged, with its well-honed pixel art and unique rotational mechanic making
